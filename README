LPP 12/13 
First Lab: Using git and first steps in Ruby

  - Use ruby 1.9.2 or later  (run ruby -v)
  - Optionally: Install rvm (https://rvm.io/) and learn to use it
  - To see the options for the Rakefile run "rake -T"
        ~/Dropbox/src/ruby/LPP/p1(master)]$ rake -T
        rake debug[player]  # Run rps_simple_command_line.rb in debugger mode
        rake rps            # Run rps_simple_command_line.rb with ruby
        rake tar            # makes a tar.gz with all the files

  - To run in debug mode write "rake debug[rock]" or "rake debug[scissors]"
